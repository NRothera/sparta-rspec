# Unit Testing

Here you will find a lot of examples for unit testing. Unit testing tests that functions are outputting the correct data or code contains the right data

#Fibonacci Sequence

To run test for fibonacci, cd into project_eurler, and then cd into fibonacci. Run rspec in the terminal to run tests.
The fibonacci code if object orientated making it more readable and easier to test.
You can add tests in the fibonacci_engine_spec.rb folder.


#Project Eurler

To run project_eurler tests, cd into project_eurler and run rspec in the terminal.
The purpose of the class Multiples_3_5 is to find all multiples of 3 and 5 up to a given number. Therefore there is a function that checks whether a number is divisible by 3 or 5, a function that will push numbers into and array if they are and a function that returns the total of all numbers placed into the aray
Tests are written in euler_engine_spec.
To write a test, write
  it 'put what you are testing for here' do
    test parameters
  end

#Calculator

To run calculator tests, cd into rspec_calculator and run rspec.
The calculator class runs some basic functions for basic calculations such as adding, subtracting, multiplication and division.
Tests are written in calc_engine_spec.rb
